Overview

Introduction
------------

The Pop PHP Framework is a lightweight, yet robust PHP framework that can be used for
rapid application development. The framework itself has a base set of core components
as well as numerous other additional components to facilitate many of the common features
needed for a PHP application.

The two main concepts behind the Pop PHP Framework have always been:

1. To be easy to use and lightweight
2. To promote standards in development while maintaining a manageable learning curve

The goal is so that anyone from an advanced programmer to a novice developer can install
and start using the Pop PHP Framework quickly and effectively.

About the Framework
-------------------

Pop PHP is an open source, object-oriented PHP framework. At a minimum, it requires
PHP 7.3. It is available on `Github`_ and through `Composer`_. The framework is tested
using `PHPUnit`_ and continuous integration is maintained using `GitHub Actions`_.

**A Brief History of Pop PHP**

The humble beginnings of the framework started back in 2009 as a small library of
components. From that, the Pop PHP Framework began to take shape and the very first
version of it was released in early 2012. That version made it to 1.7 in 2014, where
support for version 1 ended and work on version 2 began. Pop PHP 2 ushered in a
significant refactor, taking advantage of PHP 5.4, eliminating dependencies among
components, separating the components into self-contained repositories, and
incorporating `Composer`_.

On February 12, 2021, version 4.6.0 was released and it continues the development and growth
that the previous versions set forth.

Community & Support
-------------------

Being an open source project, Pop PHP welcomes input and collaboration from the
community and maintains an open dialogue with the community. Issues can be submitted
to the appropriate repository on `Github`_. Additional support and communication is
maintained in the `Gitter chat room`_ and `Twitter`_. The `API documentation`_
is located on the website.
